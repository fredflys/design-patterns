### Definition

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Design Principle

Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
HAS-A can be better than IS-A. That's why you should favor composition over inheritance.

### Notes

"Program to an interface" really means "Program to a supertype".
