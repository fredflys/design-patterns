### What is observer pattern?

Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## OO Design Principles

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between interacting objects.

When two objects are **loosely coupled**, they can interact, but they typically have very little knowledge of each other
